```javascript
// bugSolution.js - Correct Import and Configuration
import './style.css'; // Correct path to your stylesheet

// ... Your application code
```

```css
/* style.css - Correct @tailwind Directives */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Your custom styles */
.my-custom-class {
  color: blue;
}
```

**Explanation of Fixes:**

* The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct method of importing the CSS file, ensuring that the stylesheet is properly included.
* The `style.css` includes the necessary `@tailwind` directives in the correct order.  These directives are critical for Tailwind to apply the styles correctly.  The order is significant to ensure the base styles are injected before the custom styles. Missing any one of them is a common issue leading to missing styles. 

This example provides a working solution, highlighting the key steps that frequently go wrong when setting up Tailwind CSS. Remember to review your build process configurations and browser cache if issues persist.

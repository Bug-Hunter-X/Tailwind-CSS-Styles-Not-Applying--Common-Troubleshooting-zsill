```javascript
// In your main app.js file (or equivalent)
import './style.css'; // Import your CSS file

// ... rest of your JavaScript code
```

```css
/* style.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Your custom styles here */
.my-custom-class {
  color: blue;
}
```

**Problem:** The styles defined in `style.css` might not apply correctly. This can occur due to several reasons that frequently trip up developers, especially those new to Tailwind CSS.

1. **Incorrect Import Path:** Double-check if the path to your CSS file (`'./style.css'`) is accurate and relative to your main app.js file.  A minor mistake here can lead to the styles not being loaded at all.
2. **Missing or Incorrect @tailwind Directives:**  The `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, and `@tailwind utilities;` directives are crucial. Ensure these are present in your CSS file, in this order. They are necessary for Tailwind to inject its base styles, component styles, and utility classes.
3. **Incorrect Configuration (tailwind.config.js):** Check your `tailwind.config.js`. Incorrect contentRoot, content, or other configurations can prevent Tailwind from processing your CSS and applying the necessary styles.
4. **Build Process Issues:** If you are using a build process (Webpack, Parcel, Vite, etc.), ensure that your CSS is processed correctly during the build step.  Improper configuration in these tools can lead to styles being lost or broken. 
5. **CSS Specificity:** If your custom styles are being overridden, it might be a CSS specificity issue. More specific styles (such as an inline style or a style with a higher specificity selector) will override the Tailwind utility classes.  Remember that Tailwind classes are often fairly generic, so they can get overridden by more specific selectors.
6. **Caching:** Sometimes browsers can cache outdated CSS.  Try hard-refreshing the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) or clearing your browser's cache to ensure you are loading the latest styles.
